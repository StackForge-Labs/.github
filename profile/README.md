# Fullstack Product Team

**We are a student engineering team from FPT Aptech, operating with startup discipline to design, build, and scale real-world software systems.**

We treat every repository as a product asset, every feature as a business decision, and every architecture choice as a long-term investment.
As students, we focus on turning academic knowledge into production-grade engineering execution.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision**  
Build resilient digital products that solve real operational and user problems at scale.

**Mission**  
Execute with a startup mindset by combining fullstack product development, architecture research, and DevOps-first delivery practices from day one.

## What We Build

- Production-oriented web platforms and fullstack applications.
- Academic projects developed with real engineering standards.
- Internal R&D initiatives for architecture, performance, and security improvements.
- Independent product experiments focused on SaaS and platform-style solutions.
- Technical foundations and reusable components for long-term product growth.

## Engineering Approach

- Product mindset first: prioritize business value, user outcomes, and delivery speed.
- Scalable architecture: design services and modules that can evolve with product demand.
- Clean workflow: standardize branching, code review, testing, and release practices.
- CI/CD culture: automate build, test, and deployment to reduce manual risk.
- Cloud-first operations: optimize for reliability, elasticity, and operational visibility.
- Security awareness by default: apply secure coding, dependency hygiene, and access control early.
- Performance and maintainability as core quality metrics, not post-release fixes.

## Infrastructure & Deployment Strategy

- Containerized workloads with Docker to ensure environment consistency from local to production.
- GitHub Actions pipelines for automated quality gates, testing, and deployment.
- AWS-first production architecture for scalable and managed cloud services.
- VPS infrastructure for controlled environments, cost-aware deployments, and custom workloads.
- Deployment strategy focused on repeatability, rollback safety, and operational reliability.

## Product Philosophy

- Build small, ship fast, iterate with measurable feedback.
- Prefer robust fundamentals over short-term technical shortcuts.
- Design for scale early, optimize continuously with real usage data.
- Keep architecture understandable so teams can move fast without losing quality.
- Treat security, performance, and maintainability as product features.

## Future Direction / Roadmap

- Standardize multi-repository engineering playbooks and reusable templates.
- Expand CI/CD maturity with stronger automated testing and release governance.
- Increase architecture research in distributed systems and scalable backend patterns.
- Strengthen observability, incident response, and operational monitoring capabilities.
- Evolve selected internal projects into external, production-grade SaaS offerings.

## Invitation for Collaboration

We welcome collaboration with engineers, mentors, product teams, and industry partners who value practical innovation and disciplined execution.
